// given an array of n integers. maximize the sum of all the elements of the array by performing the following operations any number pof times.

// choose any two adjacent values and tild their signs.

// eg: an array with three elements

// a[3] = {-2,1,0};

// max sum = -1;

// afteer first pass, a[3] = {2,-1,0}
// after 2 pass, a[3] = {2,1,0}

// Home work
